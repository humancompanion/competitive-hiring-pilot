## Hiring Manager

<p class="usa-intro">
  The hiring manager is engaged in initiating the hiring action and may be the sponsor of the action. The hiring manager participates in the action at the beginning of the process by engaging in initial meetings and in the job analysis, although they should defer to SMEs currently in the position and may, in conjunction with sponsors, override a SME in certain circumstances. Following job analysis, the hiring manager is not involved in the action until the certificate is issued, at which point the hiring manager receives the cert and makes selections. Except for rare circumstances, a hiring manager is not allowed to serve as a SME. 
</p>

## HR Specialist

<p class="usa-intro">
  The HR specialist ensures that the hiring action adheres to merit system principles and controls all messaging to applicants about the hiring process. As with a typical hiring action, they are responsible for any HR functions related to the hiring action. Depending on the nature of assessments used, an HR Specialist may be assisted by an I/O psychologist. The HR specialist ensures that prohibitive personnel practices are monitored for and trained on throughout an action and trains/monitors SMEs such that SMEs can conduct assessment activities independently. In a multi-agency action where certificates are shared with other agencies (per the Competitive Service Act), the HR specialist will handle the mechanics of sharing the cert with other agencies.

## Project Manager

<p class="usa-intro">
  The HR specialist may serve as the project manager for an action, however, often a separate individual is designated to this role. In this case, the project manager works closely with the sponsor and with the HR specialist throughout the action. This includes coordinating the moving pieces, setting up trainings, tracking SME participation, and managing the document flow for the action - along with the other pieces involved in actions described throughout this site. They may have an HR background but may also be new to hiring work and be designated by the sponsor of the action to this role. 
</p>

## Sponsor

<p class="usa-intro">
  The sponsor leads the hiring managers and SMEs, supporting the action either via funding and/or participation in the hiring process. The sponsor can provide SMEs, engage stakeholders, and/or gather information helpful to the job analysis. The sponsor "makes the call" with HR leadership on grade levels and positions appropriate for the hiring action. 
</p>

Note: In a single agency action, a sponsor is typically the individual or representative of an entity that initiaties the action or is appointed as sponsor by a senior official. In a multi-agency action or cross-government action, a sponsor might be a representative of, or leader from, a CXO Council, working group or other entity initiating and partnering on the action.

Throughout a hiring action the sponsor may –
 - Help identify positions/grade levels for inclusion on an interest survey
 - Share information about the possible hiring action with appropriate stakeholders (eg CXO Councils, interagency groups, etc)
 - Work with appropriate stakeholders to gather materials (e.g. PDs, job announcements, competencies), that can be used for job analysis
 - Help identify SMEs and send out messaging to them throughout the process
 - If needed, work with HR to remove SMEs from the action
 - Join weekly or as needed meetings with the hiring team to answer questions, provide input on process and outreach language, advise on timeline given broader situational issues, and engage stakeholders as necessary
 - Encourage agencies to participate in the hiring action or use shared cert
 - Assist in the marketing of the job announcement once it is posted (share with CoPs, agencies, outside organizations, etc)
 - Provide additional input and insights as needed throughout the process
