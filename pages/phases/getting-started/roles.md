## Sponsor

<p class="usa-intro">
  The sponsor leads the hiring managers and SMEs, supporting the action either via funding and/or participation in the hiring process. The sponsor can provide SMEs, engages stakeholders, and/or gather information helpful to the job analysis. The sponsor "makes the call" with HR leadership on grade levels and positions appropriate for the hiring action.
</p>

Throughout a hiring action the sponsor may –
 - Help identify positions/grade levels for inclusion on an interest survey to agencies
 - Share information about the survey, SMEQA, the possible hiring action with appropriate stakeholders (eg CXO Councils, interagency groups, etc)
 - Work with appropriate stakeholders to gather PDs, job announcements, competencies, etc that can be used for a job analysis workshop
 - Help identify SMEs that can participate in a job analysis workshop, resume review, interviews, etc – and send out messaging to them throughout the process
 - Join weekly or as needed meetings with the cross-agency hiring team or agency hiring team to answer questions, provide input on process and outreach language, advise on timeline given broader situational issues, and to engage stakeholders as necessary
 - Encourage agencies to participate in the hiring action or use shared cert
 - Assist in the marketing of the job announcement once it is posted (share with CoPs, agencies, outside organizations, etc)
 - Provide additional input and insights as needed throughout the process
