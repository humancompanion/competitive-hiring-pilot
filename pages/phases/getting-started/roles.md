</p>

## HR Specialist

<p class="usa-intro">
  The HR specialist ensures that the hiring action adheres to merit system principles and controls all messaging to applicants about the hiring process.
</p>

## Project Manager

<p class="usa-intro">
  The project manager coordinates the moving pieces, setting up trainings, tracking SME participation, and managing the document flow for the action. They may have an HR background but might instead be new to hiring work.
</p>

## Sponsor

<p class="usa-intro">
  The sponsor leads the hiring managers and SMEs, supporting the action either via funding and/or participation in the hiring process. The sponsor can provide SMEs, engages stakeholders, and/or gather information helpful to the job analysis. The sponsor "makes the call" with HR leadership on grade levels and positions appropriate for the hiring action.
</p>

Throughout a hiring action the sponsor may –
 - Help identify positions/grade levels for inclusion on an interest survey
 - Share information about the possible hiring action with appropriate stakeholders (eg CXO Councils, interagency groups, etc)
 - Work with appropriate stakeholders to gather materials (e.g. PDs, job announcements, competencies), that can be used for job analysis
 - Help identify SMEs and send out messaging to them throughout the process
 - Join weekly or as needed meetings with the hiring team to answer questions, provide input on process and outreach language, advise on timeline given broader situational issues, and to engage stakeholders as necessary
 - Encourage agencies to participate in the hiring action or use shared cert
 - Assist in the marketing of the job announcement once it is posted (share with CoPs, agencies, outside organizations, etc)
 - Provide additional input and insights as needed throughout the process
