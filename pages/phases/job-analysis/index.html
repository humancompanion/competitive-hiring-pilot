roles: [hr, sme, hiring-mgr, io-psych]
duration: 2.5 to 3 days (16 hours)
outputs:
  - Agreement on required duties in the position from day one
  - 4-6 core competencies and their definitions
  - Proficiency descriptions for each competency, including the proficiency required for the hiring action
  - First round assessment materials
  - Second round assessment materials
  - Job analysis worksheet (for hiring action case file)
  - SME decisions about resume review pages and tech recency requirements (see Assessment Strategy phase)

<h3>About Core Competencies and Proficiencies</h3>
<p>
  <em>Core competencies</em> are the professional skills an applicant must possess from their first day in the position you're hiring for, while <em>proficiencies</em> gauge how skilled an applicant is with the given competency depending on years of experience, the scale of the organizations they've worked in, or the complexity of the projects they've participated in.
</p>
<p>
  The job analysis workshop bridges what may be a standardized position description (PD) with the actual job your agency is hiring for. By defining your core competencies and proficiencies, your group will have a shared understanding of the core competencies and proficiencies an applicant needs to be successful in performing the duties for a given role. You'll also:
</p>
<ul class="usa-list">
  <li>Determine the assessment criteria and qualifications for your role(s).</li>
  <li>Develop structured interview questions.</li>
  <li>Decide how to accurately describe your role to applicants in your job announcement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparing Your Workshop</h3>

<p>Your job analysis workshop should be a total of 16 active hours, which typically spans 2.5 days with breaks. Send calendar invites to as many SMEs and hiring managers who will participate in your hiring action as possible.</p>
<ul class="usa-list">
  <li>Update the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/toolkit/job-analysis/job-analysis-presentation.pptx">presentation template</a> with your agency's specific information.</li>
  <li>Update and print the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/toolkit/job-analysis/agenda-for-job-analysis-workshop/">agenda</a> as necessary for distribution at the workshop.</li>
  <li>Identify and prepare 2-4 resumes for an exercise in the workshop. Resumes should be marginally strong to force discussion, and the resumes you pick should inclulde these categories: short (2 pages or less), long (over 5 pages), private sector background, public sector background. Instructions to gather resumes are <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/hiring-phases/resume-review/training/#setting-up-resume-review-training">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Print the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/toolkit/job-analysis/sample-competencies-proficiencies.docx">Sample Competencies</a> to distribute at the workshop as supporting material.</li>
  <li>Think through the SMEs that will be attending and how to group them to avoid strong personalities overwhelming small groups.</li>
  <li>Decide in advance who will handle technical issues and present each section of slides.</li>
</ul>
