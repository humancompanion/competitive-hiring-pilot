<h2>Planning checklist before JOA posting</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If using USA Staffing, have you set up the manual assessments in order to import the SMEQA assessment results into USA Staffing? <b>Not doing this will cause a large amount of manual work.</b></li>
  <li>Do you have a final private copy of the competencies and proficiencies that SMEs have approved with language matching the JOA?</li>
  <li>Will your HR specialist be available and ready to process applicants any day that the announcement may close?</li>
  <li>Do you have a recruitment strategy? (Are the SMEs and HMs ready to do recruitment when you send them the link?)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Content checklist before JOA posting</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you have language calling out the page limit for resume review in the JOA</li>
<li>Do you explain that each round of assessment is pass/fail?</li>
<li>Have you included language allowing candidates to be considered for other hiring actions? (template language below)</li>
  <ul>
  <li>When the agency completes their selections, the remaining list of qualified candidates may be shared with additional federal agencies. You will have an opportunity to opt-in if you would like your name, application material, and assessment results shared to be considered for employment with additional agencies. There is no guarantee of further consideration and you can continue to explore job opportunity announcements.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Do you have a link to the questionnaire in your JOA?</li>
<li>Have you included the opt-in questionnaire item on being considered for employment at other agencies? (template language below)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>When the agency completes their selections, the remaining list of qualified candidates may be shared with additional federal agencies. Please opt-in here if you would like your name, application material, and assessment results shared to be considered for employment with additional agencies. There is no guarantee of further consideration and you can continue to explore job opportunity announcements.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Opt in: Please share my name, application material, and assessment results with hiring managers from other agencies.</li>
      <li>Opt out: I only want to be considered within the agency I am applying for.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
<li>Did you consider including language telling applicants the announcement will remain open for either 240 days or 365 days to maximize selections off the certificate throughout the year?</li>
<li>Do you have a recruitment plan? Have you confirmed it with your HR specialist? Are the SMEs and HMs ready to do their recruitment work when the job is posted?</li>
<li>Have you fully analyzed potential availability and days off for your coordinator and HR specialist so that the entire hiring process can proceed without unnecessary delays?</li>
<li>Did you consider planning a conference call or calls to inform possible applicants about the application process, and putting the dial in information in the JOA?</li>
<li>Is your announcement clear about the locations of each posting (per position, if different) and if you can hire people remotely? (candidates may assume positions are remote-friendly)</li>
<li>Do you have the elements on your announcement so that you can make successful offers? For example:</li>
  <ul>
      <li>Relocation incentives</li>
      <li>Recruitment incentives/superior quals statements (these are not the same)</li>
      <li>Promotion potential
      <li>Position sensitivity/clearance information</li>
      <li>Drug test requirements</li>
      <li>Telework eligibility</li>
      <li>Eligibility for 100% remote work, or work at satellite office locations</li>
      <li>Travel requirement</li>
      <li>Categories being used</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
