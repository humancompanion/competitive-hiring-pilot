<h2>Data Science</h2>

<p class="usa-intro">
  In August 2020, USDS, OPM, and the Chief Data Officer council initiated the multi-agency Data Science Hiring Action Pilot using the SME-QA process. Ten federal agencies (16 components) initially participated, followed by selections from more agencies. The CDO council published <a href="https://www.cdo.gov/news/data-scientist-hiring-pilot/">the results of the action in June 2021</a> and the cert is available for selections until Spring 2022.

<h3>Lesson Learned: types of data people</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Data Analysts help you understand and describe your data.</li>
 <li>Data Scientists help build models to explain your data or predict things about data and outcomes you haven't seen before, and can help you scope data.</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Some data scientists specialize in Causal Inference -- they help you understand root causes of things. They are especially good for tasks like A/B testing, social science-y questions, and power calculations.</li>
      <li>Some data scientists specialize in Machine Learning -- they help you make predictions about data you haven't seen before. They are especially good at building predictive models. </li>
      <li>Some data scientists are on the cutting edge of Deep Learning or Generative Modeling -- they can help with "easy for humans, hard for computers" problems, like writing an essay or drawing a picture. </li>
   </ul>
 <li>Data Engineers help you build tooling to process and manage large volumes of data.</li>
</ul>
